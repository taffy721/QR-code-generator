# QR-code-generator
This is a QR code generator I made using python.

How to install and run:

1. Go into your terminal and type 'git clone https://github.com/taffy721/QR-code-generator' or press on code and then press on download zip

2. If you downloaded the zip make sure to unzip it

3. Finally double click on qrcode.exe

Not: Please do not remove the qrcodeimages folder because that is where the images of the qr code you have generated go and the application may not work properly without it.
